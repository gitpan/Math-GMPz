This module wraps all of the 'mpz' (integer) functions that
version 4.2 of the Gnu MP (GMP) library provides.

To build this module you need perl 5.6.0 or later. I'm not sure of all
the requirements to get it to build with earlier versions of perl, but
it's definite that the XS code relating to operator overloading will 
not compile with perl versions prior to 5.6.

No OO interface - just plain access to GMP's integer functions.

Build in the usual way:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

When building this module, the GMP library will need to be accessible.
If it's not in a location where your compiler finds it by default, 
then instead of running 'perl Makefile.PL', you'll need to run:

perl Makefile.pl INC="-I/path/to/gmp_include" LIBS="-L/path/to/gmp_lib -lgmp"
